# DISCLAIMER

This code was not written by our team. This code belongs to this repository: https://github.dev/ggomaeng/react-native-tetris

## Why did we include it?

Our customer said, because we worked so fast on the features we might as well implement tetris as a joke.

Due to the funny aspect of actually implementing it, improving our relationship with the customer, and the rather low effort needed to integrate the app, we decided on implement it as a joke
